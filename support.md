## Sign Up Links 
I use all of the brands/products listed in my research program. Depending on the brand/product, when you sign up for a subscription or purchase a product with my personalized links below, I receive either a discounted subscription rate, coupons for future purchases, or a small percentage of my initial purchase back in cash (e.g., 5%). Beyond the financial benefit I stand to gain from listing these brands/products here, person to person-- my work has benefitted from using them, and I highly recommend them to others with similar needs. I've tried to include a brief description of each to help others assess if these products are right for their work too.

Less important emails are automatically filtered into a separate folder and then summarized in a daily digest. We also have a full suite of other features that boost your email productivity.

  - When you spend  hours a day seated in the same position, no matter how optimal, stress builds up in your body. Movement is crucial to relieving this strain. TITAN Evo is designed to promote natural posture changes and movement.
