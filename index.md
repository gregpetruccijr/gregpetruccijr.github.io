# Quick Summary

I am a PhD. student at the University of Massachusetts in the [Department of Kinesiology](https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/kinesiology), stuyding under [John R. Sirard, PhD.](https://blogs.umass.edu/pahl/about-us/bios/john-sirard/). My research expertise is in the area of using accelerometers to estimate aspects of physical behaviors (e.g., physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep). To that end, I've worked extensively on projects aimed at calibration and validation of accelerometer data processing methods (see [MOCA](https://gregpetrucci.com/moca/) for more details). I'm also keen on making accelerometer data processing methods (i.e., exsisiting and new, simple cut-points and complex machine learning techniques, etc.) easily accessible for use in intervention and cohort studies.
