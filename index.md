**Welcome!**
- _My name is Greg Petrucci, and I am a researcher passionate about innovating human health with wearable technology_. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts in the [Department of Kinesiology](https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/kinesiology) working under the supervision of  [John R. Sirard, PhD.](https://blogs.umass.edu/pahl/about-us/bios/john-sirard/). I also work closely with [John Staudenmayer](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/directory/faculty/john-staudenmayer). My research interests lie in using accelerometers to estimate aspects of physical behaviors (e.g., physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep).

**Research**
 - I've worked extensively on projects aimed at calibration and validation of accelerometer data processing methods (see [MOCA](https://gregpetrucci.com/moca/) for more details).
 
- _Recently I've been keen on making accelerometer data processing methods (i.e., existing and new, simple cut-points and complex machine learning techniques) easily accessible for use in intervention and cohort studies._ I plan to build on the work of [Clevenger et al.,][1] and [Pffeiffer et al.,][2] where my specific goals are to: 
	1) ecologically identify and 
	2) provide (end)user-friendly access to

accelerometer data processing methods that are accurate, reliable, and sensitive to detect changes in physical behaviors that are known to be associated with human health.

**Publications, Conference Abstracts and Presentations**
- The [Publications page](pubs.md)  lists my refereed publications (links included), conference abstracts, presentations and more. At the bottom of that page a _.pdf_ copy of [my CV](/assets/js/viewerjs-0.5.8/ViewerJS/PetrucciJr_CV_03_28_24.pdf) is available for download.

**Teaching**
- Teaching is equally important and exciting to me as working in the lab is. Connecting with undergraduate students is so much fun.  [My CV](PetrucciJr_CV_11_30_23.pdf) lists all my teaching experiences (e.g., laboratory teaching assistantships and instructor of record).

**Get in Touch**
- I am always interested in new collaborations, expanding my research network and general chatter. Feel free to reach out to me via email at [gp@gregpetrucci.com].
