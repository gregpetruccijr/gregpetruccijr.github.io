**Welcome!**
- _My name is Greg Petrucci, and I am a researcher passionate about innovating human health with wearable technology_. I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Massachusetts in the [Department of Kinesiology](https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/kinesiology) working under the supervision of [John R. Sirard, Ph.D.](https://blogs.umass.edu/pahl/about-us/bios/john-sirard/). I also work closely with [John Staudenmayer](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/directory/faculty/john-staudenmayer). My research interests lie in using accelerometers to estimate aspects of physical behaviors (e.g., physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep).

**Research**
 - I've worked extensively on projects aimed at calibration and validation of accelerometer data processing methods (see [MOCA](https://gregpetrucci.com/moca/) for more details).
 
- _Recently I've been keen on making accelerometer data processing methods (i.e., existing and new, simple cut-points and complex machine learning techniques) easily accessible for use in intervention and cohort studies._ I plan to build on the work of [Clevenger et al.,][1] and [Pffeiffer et al.,][2] where my specific goals are to 1) ecologically identify and 2) provide (end)user-friendly access to accelerometer data processing methods that are accurate, reliable, and sensitive to detect changes in physical behaviors that are known to be associated with human health.

**Publications, Conference Abstracts, and Presentationsüìö**
- [üìö](pubs.md) (publications page) lists my refereed publications, conference abstracts, presentations, and more. Including a _.pdf_ of my somewhat up-to-date? [CV](https://gregpetrucci.com/assets/js/viewerjs-0.5.8/ViewerJS/PetrucciJr_CV_03_28_24.pdf).

**Teaching**
- Teaching is equally important and exciting to me as working in the lab. Connecting with undergraduate students is so much fun.  [My CV](PetrucciJr_CV_03_28_24.pdf) lists all my teaching experiences (e.g., laboratory teaching assistantships and instructor of record).
- Be on the lookout for a [üìî post](https://gregpetrucci.com/2024-04-07-fall-24-courses/) announcing my Summer 2024, Fall 2024, and Spring 2025 teaching schedule.
