# Quick Summary
I am a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts in the [Department of Kinesiology](https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/kinesiology) studying with [John R. Sirard, PhD.]([https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/person/faculty/john-r-sirard](https://www.umass.edu/public-health-sciences/about/directory/john-sirard)). I am a research assistant on the [MOCA Project](https://blogs.umass.edu/pahl/research/moca/) and my research interests include the development of accelerometer data processing methods to estimate aspects of physical behavior (e.g., physical activity and sedentary behavior). 

The MOCA project uses direct observation as the criterion measure of physical behavior. We use our direct observation system to develop and test methods for estimating physical behaviors using accelerometer data. You can read about our direct observation system [here](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jmpb/aop/article-10.1123-jmpb.2019-0015/article-10.1123-jmpb.2019-0015.xml).

Some of our [latest work](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31343523-estimating-sedentary-time-from-a-hip-and-wrist-worn-accelerometer/?from_term=marcotte+medicine+and+science+in+sport+and+exercise&from_pos=1) from the MOCA project assessed the validity of existing methods to estimate sedentary behavior under free-living conditions using the ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer.
