### What is a RAP?
Residential Academic Programs, or RAPs, are small communities of new first-year and transfer students who live in the same residence hall and enroll in the same small course together. 
You can read more about RAPs here: [https://www.umass.edu/studentsuccess/RAP/about]
### Are there prerequisites?
